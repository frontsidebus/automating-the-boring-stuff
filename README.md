# My attempt to automate the boring stuff.
As I go through *Automate The Boring Stuff with Python* (Al Sweigart), 
I'm using this repo as a collection of code from each chapter
some of it is super simple, but I'm forcing myself to write it all and commit
it, as an exercise in learning the fundamentals of python3
maybe you'll find it useful
*if anything it should be a good reference...*
