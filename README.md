# Automating-The-Boring-Stuff
#As I go through automate the boring stuff (Al Sweigart's Python book), 
#I'm using this repo as a collection of code from each chapter
#some of it is super simple, but I'm forcing myself to write it all and commit
#it, as an exercise in learning the fundamentals of python3
#maybe you'll find it useful
#if anything it should be a good reference...
